# RNN_XOR
This MATLAB code deals with an XOR problem solved by RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).
Sigmoid function is used for activation function on each nodes.
Sequence length is two, e.g. one hidden layer with previous step (T-1) and another current step (T) of hidden layer are used.
Root mean square of error is used as loss function.
Backpropagation algorithm is derived on pdf file.
